Recently, many friends who want to learn Python have joined our communication group one after another. At present, the number of our communication group has exceeded 10,000. Our goal is to create a high-quality Python communication community. On the one hand, it clears the obstacles in the entry process for beginners who want to learn Python; on the other hand, it provides a way for new developers to ask questions and help them quickly grow into excellent ones. Professionals; In addition, experienced developers can use this platform to share or provide their work experience for free, so that everyone can get a comprehensive promotion of professional skills and comprehensive quality. The previous public classes and offline technical exchange activities have been abandoned for some time because of work. However, the small partners are still active in the communication group and support us as always, thank you here. Recently, the content of the first 15 days and the last 10 days has been continuously updated. The first 15 days are written for beginners. I hope that the difficulty of getting started will be further reduced, and the example program will be simpler and clearer. The last 10 days are related to the actual combat of Python projects and interviews. I hope that the content is more detailed and complete, especially the interview question on the 100th day. It is not easy to create. Thank you for your support. The money will not be used for coffee purchases but will be donated to the people in need through the Tencent public welfare platform. ( Click for donations).

Software process model

### Classic Process Model (Waterfall Model)

Feasibility analysis (do or don't do research), output "feasibility analysis report".
Requirement analysis (research what to do), output "Requirement Specification" and product interface prototype diagram.
Summary design and detailed design, output conceptual model diagram (ER diagram), physical model diagram, class diagram, timing diagram, etc.
Coding / testing.
Go Live / Maintenance.
The biggest shortcoming of the waterfall model is that it cannot embrace changes in demand. The product can only be seen after the entire process is completed, and the morale of the team is low.

Scrum-Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer-Sprint

Product Backlog (user story, product prototype).

Planning meetings (evaluation and budget).

Daily development (stand-up meetings, tomato work, pair programming, test-first, code refactoring ...).

Fix bugs (problem description, recurring steps, testers, assignees).

release version.

Review meeting (Showcase, users need to participate).

Retrospective (to summarize the current iteration cycle).

Added: Manifesto for Agile Software Development

Individuals and interactions above processes and tools working software above detailed documentation
Customer cooperation above contract negotiation.
Response to change is higher than following plan


### Role: Product owner (who decides what to do and who can make a decision on the needs), team leader (solve various issues, focus on how to work better, shield the external influence on the development team), development team (project executive, Specifically developers and testers).

Preparations: business case and funding, contract, vision, initial product requirements, initial release plan, shareholding, team formation.

Agile teams usually have 8-10 people.

Estimation of workload: Quantify development tasks, including prototypes, logo design, UI design, front-end development, etc. Try to break down each task to the minimum task amount, the minimum task amount standard is that the working time cannot exceed two days, and then estimate the overall project time . Stick each task on the kanban, which is divided into three parts: to do (to be completed), in progress, and done.

Project team formation

Team composition and role

Note: Thank you, Ms. Fu Xiangying, for drawing this beautiful organization chart.

Programming specifications and code review (flake8, pylint)



Some "conventions" in Python (refer to "Python Conventions-How to Write Pythonic Code" )

Reasons affecting code readability:

Too few or no comments
Code breaks language best practices
Anti-pattern programming (spaghetti code, copy-paste programming, conceit programming, ...)
Team Development Tools

Version control: Git, Mercury
Defect Management: Gitlab , Redmine
Agile closed-loop tools: Zen Tao , JIRA
Continuous integration: Jenkins , Travis-CI
Please refer to "Problems and Solutions for Team Project Development" .

Project selection and understanding business
Topic selection range setting

CMS (user terminal): news aggregation site, Q & A / share community, film review / book review site, etc.

MIS (user side + management side): KMS, KPI assessment system, HRS, CRM system, supply chain system, warehouse management system, etc.

App background (management side + data interface): second-hand transactions, newspapers and magazines, niche e-commerce, news and information, travel, social, reading, etc.

Other types: own industry background and work experience, business is easy to understand and control.

Requirements understanding, module division and task allocation

Need understanding: brainstorming and competitive product analysis.
Module division: draw a mind map (XMind), each module is a branch node, and each specific function is a leaf node (expressed by a verb). You need to ensure that each leaf node cannot reproduce a new node and determine each leaf Node importance, priority, and workload.
Task assignment: The project leader assigns tasks to each team member according to the above indicators.

Comparison of Gunicorn and uWSGI
For simple applications that do not require a lot of customization, Gunicorn is a good choice. The learning curve of uWSGI is much steeper than Gunicorn. The default parameters of Gunicorn can already adapt to most applications.
uWSGI supports heterogeneous deployment.
Because Nginx natively supports uWSGI, Nginx and uWSGI are usually bundled together for deployment online, and uWSGI is a fully functional and highly customized WSGI middleware.
In terms of performance, Gunicorn and uWSGI actually perform similarly.
